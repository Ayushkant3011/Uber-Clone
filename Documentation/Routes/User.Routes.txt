We need Routes as they provide a structured way to direct data packets across a network to their intended destination

this user routes will have express and router and user.Controller as well to direct the data 



-creating reister route for the user as new user needs to be registered
	router.post('/register', [
		body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Invalid Email'),
		body('fullname.firstname').isLength({min:3}).withMessage('First Name should be atleast 3 characters long'),
		body('password').isLength({min:6}).withMessage('Password should be atleast 6 characters long'),
	],
		userController.registerUser
	);
