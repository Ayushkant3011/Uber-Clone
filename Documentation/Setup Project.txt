Creating a Full stack project by using MERN Stack 

you need 2 separate folder for backend and frontend 

in this project for creating backend :
		1. npm init -y ----> this file is for package.json
		2. npm i express --> installs the express server
		
For using global values we use dotenv to integarte the values into our file 
	- npm i dotenv

	const dotenv = require('dotenv');
	dotenv.config();  --- this code will help load the env file into the current file 
	


CORS- Cross origin Resource Sharing
-simply a way where a client web app will be loaded in one domain and can gain access to the resources that are present in other domain 
- mainly it is used while integrating the third-party APIs
	const cors = require('cors');
	app.use(cors());
