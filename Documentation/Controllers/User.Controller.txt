- We need User Model in the controller to successfully create a user that is going to use the app 


- Register User:
	const User = await userService.createUser({
			firstname:fullname.firstname,
			lastname:fullname.lastname,
			email,
			password:hashedPassword
		});
	this code will create the user after checking some condition 
	
	
- Generating the token 
    const token = User.generateAuthToken();



    res.status(201).json({ token, User }); ----> this will say that the user is created successfully.
