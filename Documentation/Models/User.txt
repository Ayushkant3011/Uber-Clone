Creating user model means creating how we are going to store the user data in the DB 

to create a user we are goint to need two packages to create the password and generate the token 

npm i bcrypt jsonwebtoken --> this will install the bcrypt library that is provided to encrypt the password and jwt to genearte the token 

going to need mongoose to create the userSchema 

UserSchema:
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    fullname:{
        firstname:{
            type:String,
            required:true,
            minlength:[3, "First Name should be atleast 3 characters long"],
        },
        lastname:{
            type:String,
            minlength:[3, 'Last Name should be atleast 3 characters long'],
        }
    },
    email:{
        type:String,
        required:true,
        unique:true,
        minlength:[6, 'Email should be atleast 6 characters long'],
    },
    password:{
        type:String,
        required:true,
        select:false,
    },
    
    socketId:{
        type:String,
    },
});


and in this user model we are also going to create methods to generate AuthToken and haspassword


Here I have used userSchema.methods.hashPassword so that was the wrong method. 
userSchema.statics.hashPassword = async function(password){
    return await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
}


module.exports = userModel; ----> this statement will export the user model
